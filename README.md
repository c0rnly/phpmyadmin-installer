# phpmyadmin-installer

Hi, here is a small shell document with which you can install FiveM on your Linux server with 2 commands! --> Upload the file to your server and run it. --> In most cases this is then [cd /home] if you put the files in the home folder and then only [bash phpmyadmin-Oneklick.sh]
